All notable changes to this project _after release v3.0.0_ will be documented in this file.

## v3.0.0 - Unreleased
Following (pending) release v3.0.0 (and onwards) this repository will serve solely as a model zoo for pretrained neuroimaging models from various publications. This entails that the utilities that were previously packaged alongside the models (e.g. for training models) has been stripped, to avoid bloating the repository. If you are interested in specific code for a specific paper either check out the previous releases or email me at [estenhl@uio.no](mailto:estenhl@uio.no)
